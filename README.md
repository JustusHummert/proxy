## Features
### Admin interface
The subdomain "admin" is used to access the admin interface.
The admin logs in with the password that is set as a command line argument.
Then he can add and remove subdomain and URL combinations.

### Forwarding
If a user sends an request to a subdomain that was previously added by the admin,
 his request is forwarded to the server and the answer is forwarded to him.
